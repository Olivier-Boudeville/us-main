This is the repository of the **Universal Server**, which is a multi-service daemon in charge of the automation (monitoring, scheduling and performing) of various computer-based tasks, such as the proper management of the server itself or, in the future, of house automation.

The US server is a part of the [Universal Server](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/Universal-Server) umbrella project; it depends on [us-common](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-common/), and may be used with or without the US Webserver (defined in [us-web](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-web/)).

Please refer to the [Universal Server official documentation](http://us.esperide.org) for further information, otherwise to its [mirror](http://olivier-boudeville.github.io/us-main/).

The 'master' branch is aimed to be the current stable version of this layer.
