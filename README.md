# us-main

This is the repository of the **Universal Server** itself, which is a multi-service daemon allowing to perform the monitoring and scheduling of various computer-based tasks.

The US server depends on [us-common](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-common/), and may be used with or without [us-main](https://github.com/Olivier-Boudeville/us-main/).
