% This is a configuration file of rebar3, so that the us_main application can
% better integrate in the current OTP ecosystem, despite its (more complex,
% probably more flexible) native build based on GNU make.
%
% If the name of this file is 'rebar.config', then it is a generated file,
% otherwise it is a template (located in conf/rebar.config.template), meant to
% be filled by information determined at build time or coming from
% GNUmakevars.inc.
%
% See the Myriad counterpart file (same name) for more explanations.


% Base layout was obtained thanks to: 'rebar3 new app us_main', as US-Main is an
% active OTP application (not a mere library).

% To be taken into account, from the library root, through 'make
%  rebar3-application' or 'make rebar3-release'.


% Settings for the 'default' profile follow.


% Depends on the following applications (Erlang implied):
%
% (note: if changing any information there, run from the root the 'real-clean'
%  make target, at least to force an update of rebar.lock)
%
% We prefer here listing most dependencies explicitly (ex: Myriad, Seaplus,
% etc., could be implied; yet for example erlang-serial is implied behind
% Oceanic):
