# Lightweight rebuild (no prior cleaning)
update: pull build


# Note that, after a sync done through the 'sync-us-main' target, on the server,
# for a module X, X.erl and X.beam are likely to bear the same timestamp, so a
# mere 'build' may not attempt to recreate the transferred X.beam, whereas it
# might be obsolete from the start, compared to the X.erl.
#
# So 'rebuild' is a safer target than 'build', and BEAM files shall not be
# rsync'ed. However, as the target tree is generally owned by a different user
# then the user performing, on the client side, the rsync, the timestamps of the
# rsync'ed files are not updated anymore (as otherwise that operation is bound
# to fail) and thus shall not be relied upon.
#
# As a consequence, prefer rebuilding to building, or ensure to rsync'ed BEAM
# files that are up-to-date (this is what the sync targets try to do).
